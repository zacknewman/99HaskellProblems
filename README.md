# 99HaskellProblems
My answers/functions to the Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems.
In addition to adhering to best practices, I try to build every
function I use from scratch even if an equivalent function
exists in the Prelude module; consequently there are two
modules in this repository: a "MyPrelude" module that contains functions
that are used within the other module, "NinetyNineProblems."
